    <h1>Pigmentation Breakage</h1>
    <p>After a long time discovering the best options for her hair to be naturally cared for, and to grow, 
    Forest found that she is, actually, naturally platinum blonde and that her hair was being pigmented dark, somehow. 
    This discovery led to her understanding that she needs to bleach out unnatural pigment from her hair, in order to 
    have a natural experience in life.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, looking to see the negative effects from the pigmentation, she could begin to recognise that the 
    pigmenting, from an unknown source and person(s), was causing ailment, particularly breakage. Skin damage, hair 
    damage, and internal damage, were all results of her being unnaturally pigmented. Her hair began to weaken in places 
    where unnaturally pigmented (inked), causing breakages in her hair, after further re-applications of ink, by person(s).</p>
    <p>Forest is not sure who is inking her hair or why they are doing it. Many times, she witnesses some issues such as the 
    acceptance of the inking practice by others as forms of "preservation" of her hair, as if it is a form of "security". 
    The accumulating evidence, suggests already, that it is ailing to have any inking, whatsoever, on anyone's body, a practice 
    to apply such substances as that of taking advantage of a rate of ability to heal one's self for entertainment.</p>
    <p>She finds that it is more dangerous to cloak one's natural, organic, appearance, than to be presently one's self. 
    Others may not understand or will misunderstand who a cloaked person is, causing the possibility of treatment towards that 
    person such as that of another, natural protection of that person such as that of another.</p>
    <h2>Pigmentation Poisoning</h2>
    <p>Conditions beginning from inking start with Pigmentation Poisoning. Over a long amount of time, and much inking, 
    poisoning can occur within the person being inked. Any form of unnatural pigmentation, (fake tan, tinting, ink, henna), 
    can lead to Pigmentation Poisoning in amounts, prolonged, such as this. Removal Chemicals are then required for those 
    individuals, suffering Pigmentation Poisoning, in order to detox out the unnatural pigments, not belonging and causing 
    ailment within their bodies, causing disability to an extent.</p>
    <h3>Removal Chemical Damage</h3>
    <p>Depending on the level of natural hierarchy in the origins of the inked person, (where they are from, where their 
    family's minerals exist), this is the maximum level of Removal Chemical that can be withstood, by the inked person, 
    prior to breakage, ailment, or chemical burning from Removal Chemicals.</p>
    <p>Forest, for instance, struggles to find bleach strong enough to cleanse her hair all of the way, originating from the 
    place on Earth with the purest minerals (Voorne Putten, NL), that are rarely available for import, or are at too high of 
    an expense for her aquirement. She struggles to get her hair back close to her natural state, for those reasons.</p>
    <h3>Cancer Toxicity</h3>
    <p>In reference to the <a href="cancer.html" target="_blank">Cancer document</a>, under the Carnivore category, it can 
    be seen that there is some form of inking that has occurred in the images of Alopecia. Inking can slow down the process 
    of healing forms of Cancer, such as Alopecia, and it can also be seen needing to be detoxed out of the body, by cells, 
    making it a causing factor for what I have termed, here, as Pigmentation Poisoning.</p>
    <p>Other forms of pigmentation, such as tattooing, can also be toxic at high volumes, over time, tattoos needing to naturally 
    detoxify out of the body over time.</p>
