    <h1>Rabies</h1>
    <p>Rabies is the contamination from raw flesh in the body. Plants do not often get 
    rabies, but any other creature can. The closer their species is to that of plants, 
    they cannot get rabies, so much so as is that.</p>
    <p>The etymology of "rabies", as a word, comes from two different roots, "raw" & "bies". 
    "Raw" means that something has not been cooked or is dead. In Dutch, and preserved in Afrikaans, 
    "raw" is synonymous with "remains". It is speaking about the remains of some sort of person. 
    When we look at "bies", in Dutch and Afrikaans, it is pronounced more so such as, "beueus", 
    close to the word beau, in English. Further back from there, we see usage of the word, "bies", 
    meaning man, person, body, or flesh. It was later used as a term of skin, as can be seen in Afrikaans, 
    for fur trading. Together, the words making "rabies", "raw" "bies", mean dead bodies.</p>
    <p>Now, if you have already read my <a href="cancer.html">Cancer Research Document</a>, you will know that dead bodies are also,
    found in Cancer. This is true, but the rate at which the tumor is forming is different within cancer. 
    It is more of that from that of semen and milk, with bone growths such as from those, not dead bodies.</p>
    <h2>Current Rabies Outbreak</h2>
    <p>Today, November 4, 2025, is a day marking the discovery of an extremely severe global rabies outbreak. 
    Currently, rabies is in plant-based foods, most people, and most animals (including insects). While insects 
    do aid in detoxing rabies, they also carry other forms of contaminants, such as <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/nuclear/n-contamination.html">N-Contamination</a>.
    While N-Contamination is lethal in high doses or without means of detoxing the contamination, it does serve a purpose here. 
    The ability it has to provide Nuclear Cook, noted at the bottom of the linked Research Document, allows for its use to 
    cook rabies, existing in a living body. While this knowledge is helpful in order to feel calm and manage the amount of 
    N-Contamination within the body, it is not completely necessary, if insects are able to continue to share healing 
    with their blood drawing in the <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Conservation/Boem/conservation/natural_conservation/organic_conservation/organic_beholding/organic_preservation/organic_network/organic_network.html">Organic Network</a>.</p>
    <p>Several problems have caused this outbreak, one being a recent celestial body explosion. This explosion caused 
    an extreme charge to further N-Contamination into a global pandemic, known as Covid. Other causes include the following: 
    meat industrialisation, farming industrialisation, antibiotic misuse, nuclear warfare, excess nuclear electricity, and 
    the normalisation of meat diets. Further, we are uncertain of the extent of what cannibalism could have been taking 
    place, during these times of pandemonium.</p>
    <p>Cannibalism stems from the roots: "cannabis", "bal", and "ism". What that means, put together, is the demonisation of 
    the eating of Cannabis. This would then cause, in historical times, eating of dead bodies for Cannabis, from starvation (occassionally famine), 
    and then would form into outbreaks of Rabies. It is such form of Rabies, that we are seeing today in majority of the cases. 
    See my <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/carnivore/plant-based_taurine.html">Plant-Based Taurine</a> Research Document for more information.</p>
    <p>This rabies pandemic started in Early February of 2019.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Major symptoms of Rabies begin with the taste of remains. Salvia becomes like flowing remains. Depending on the amount of 
    rabies contamination, up to foaming of remains saliva can occur (commonly known from wildlife instances). Other symptoms and post-cursoring conditions include: 
    deep bone marrow rotting and bone fracturing, bone displacement, mental fogginess, intense confusion, lost agility, rapid aging, 
    loss of dexterity, loss of muscle tissue, malnourishment, deep fracturing, bone softness, neural decay, nervous decay, and deeping 
    forms of decay within the body.</p>
    <p>In cases, patients can be seen without the ability to digest or detox out other forms of contamination coexisting along, from the 
    rabies or from the environment.</p>
