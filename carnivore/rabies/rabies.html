    <h1>Rabies</h1>
    <p>Rabies is the contamination from raw flesh in the body. Plants do not often get 
    rabies, but any other creature can. The closer their species is to that of plants, 
    they cannot get rabies, so much so as is that.</p>
    <p>The etymology of "rabies", as a word, comes from two different roots, "raw" & "bies". 
    "Raw" means that something has not been cooked or is dead. In Dutch, and preserved in Afrikaans, 
    "raw" is synonymous with "remains". It is speaking about the remains of some sort of person. 
    When we look at "bies", in Dutch and Afrikaans, it is pronounced more so such as, "beueus", 
    close to the word beau, in English. Further back from there, we see usage of the word, "bies", 
    meaning man, person, body, or flesh. It was later used as a term of skin, as can be seen in Afrikaans, 
    for fur trading. Together, the words making "rabies", "raw" "bies", mean dead bodies.</p>
    <p>Now, if you have already read my <a href="cancer.html">Cancer Research Document</a>, you will know that dead bodies are also,
    found in Cancer. This is true, but the rate at which the tumor is forming is different within cancer. 
    It is more of that from that of semen and milk, with bone growths such as from those, not dead bodies.</p>
    <h2>Current Rabies Outbreak</h2>
    <p>Today, November 4, 2025, is a day marking the discovery of an extremely severe global rabies outbreak. 
    Currently, rabies is in plant-based foods, most people, and most animals (including insects). While insects 
    do aid in detoxing rabies, they also carry other forms of contaminants, such as <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/nuclear/n-contamination.html">N-Contamination</a>.
    While N-Contamination is lethal in high doses or without means of detoxing the contamination, it does serve a purpose here. 
    The ability it has to provide Nuclear Cook, noted at the bottom of the linked Research Document, allows for its use to 
    cook rabies, existing in a living body. While this knowledge is helpful in order to feel calm and manage the amount of 
    N-Contamination within the body, it is not completely necessary, if insects are able to continue to share healing 
    with their blood drawing in the <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Conservation/Boem/conservation/natural_conservation/organic_conservation/organic_beholding/organic_preservation/organic_network/organic_network.html">Organic Network</a>.</p>
    <p>Several problems have caused this outbreak, one being a recent celestial body explosion. This explosion caused 
    an extreme charge to further N-Contamination into a global pandemic, known as Covid. Other causes include the following: 
    meat industrialisation, farming industrialisation, antibiotic misuse, nuclear warfare, excess nuclear electricity, and 
    the normalisation of meat diets. Further, we are uncertain of the extent of what cannibalism could have been taking 
    place, during these times of pandemonium.</p>
    <p>Cannibalism stems from the roots: "cannabis", "bal", and "ism". What that means, put together, is the demonisation of 
    the eating of Cannabis. This would then cause, in historical times, eating of dead bodies for Cannabis, from starvation (occassionally famine), 
    and then would form into outbreaks of Rabies. It is such form of Rabies, that we are seeing today in majority of the cases. 
    See my <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/carnivore/plant-based_taurine.html">Plant-Based Taurine</a> Research Document for more information.</p>
    <p>This rabies pandemic started in Early February of 2019.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Major symptoms of Rabies begin with the taste of remains. Saliva becomes like flowing remains. Depending on the amount of 
    rabies contamination, up to foaming of remains saliva can occur (commonly known from wildlife instances). Other symptoms and post-cursoring conditions include: 
    deep bone marrow rotting and bone fracturing, bone displacement, mental fogginess, intense confusion, lost agility, rapid aging, 
    loss of dexterity, loss of muscle tissue, malnourishment, deep fracturing, bone softness, neural decay, nervous decay, and deepening 
    forms of decay within the body.</p>
    <p>In cases, patients can be seen without the ability to digest or detox out other forms of contamination coexisting along, from the 
    rabies or from the environment. Symptoms can worsen to the state of the loss of bodily functions, leading to the loss of bodily control.</p>
    <h2>Microscopic Analysis</h2>
    <p>Microscopically, we can witness that rabies is tied to different forms of dead flesh. Let's begin to take a look with that is available to the public.</p>
    <h3>Ground Beef</h3>
    <a href="https://www.123rf.com/photo_12853747_close-up-raw-ground-beef.html"><img src="ground_beef.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Raw Ground Beef</figcaption>
    <p>When we begin to consider where we have begun with thinking about the Etymology of Rabies, we can start with looking at what is most commonly available, in that sense, 
    ground beef. Ground Beef is a form of remains from the bodies of cows that has been churned by sharp rotary machine blades. The cells, ligaments, and parts of the cows' bodies 
    have been processed and formed into tubular microshapes, as we will see, through methods of extruding and mashing of the cows' bodies.</p>
    <p>Above, we can see what that "ground beef" looks like in a photograph.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Raw Hamburger</h3>
    <a href="https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/techniques/phasegallery/rawmeat.html"><img src="raw_hamburger.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Phase Contrast Micrograph of Raw Hamburger</figcaption>
    <p>Here, in this image, above, we can see what raw hamburger looks like, microscopically. It has some muscle tissues (center) that are tubular in shape, having the 
    look of being expunged through extrusion tubes, having an apparent microscopic effect on the cellular shapes.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Frozen and Defrosted Beef</h3>
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scanning-electron-microscope-images-100-000-of-beef-loin-muscle-on-15-d-a-CR_fig1_358910207"><img src="frozen_beef.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Electron Microscope Images of Raw, Frozen, and Defrosted Beef</figcaption>
    <p>This series of images begins to show the changes of what occurs to beef, after defrost of the beef. We can see that from left to right, raw to defrosted (frozen in center), 
    the beef becomes soft, from defrosting as is the process, for the processing. Upon ground beef, perhaps, the details do not explain, for this amount.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Cooked Meat</h3>
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Microstructure-of-meat-as-revealed-by-LM-left-2-images-and-SEM-right-4-images_fig4_257742788"><img src="cooked_meat.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Electron Microscopic Images of Unmarinated and Marinated Uncooked and Cooked Meat</figcaption>
    <p>Above, the gloomy photos of what marinade does to remains is shown. It hydrates the remains to a life-like softness, when "raw". With the 
    uniform methods of machine processing the remains for kitchen production, the cells and tissues begin to soften, over frosting and defrosting cycles, 
    into uniform granule shapes for consumption. After cooking, the marinaded meat retains its straightness from being held life-like in preservatives, while 
    the non-marinaded meat begins to crinkle into segments. Finally, we can see the transverse view of the ligaments or cells are held closely together with the 
    marinading preservatives, while the non-marinaded cooked meat begins to break apart.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Taurine</h3>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F2076-0817%2F12%2F8%2F1049&psig=AOvVaw31OeSnhIkb_VNFEnCpWUUI&ust=1755795106719000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBUQjRxqFwoTCICqh62Wmo8DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAK"><img src="../electron-taurine.jpg"></a>
        <figcaption>Electron Microscopic Image of Taurine</figcaption>
    <p>When we look at this image of Taurine, a hap-digested instance of Cannabis, more in the Plant-Based Taurine Discovery (linked above under Current Rabies Outbreak), we can begin to reconise what is feathering from 
    the digesting process inside of the pancreas and body. While this may be a cannabidiod derived from meat, from within meat, it does show the process of digestion and the effect that it 
    has upon granules or cells, visually.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Rabies Cells</h3>
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Electron-micrographs-of-low-pH-incubated-rabies-virus-negatively-stained-with-sodium_fig1_14762531"><img src="rabies.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Electron Micrographs of Cooking Rabies Cells with Incubation</figcaption>
    <p>Beginning with low heat, these Rabies Cells have been warmed as in cooking. Potentially, these cells can be cooked in order to help them to be detoxed out of the body. 
    When we look at their shape, they look like chopped ground beef cells that have been begun to be digested in a body, struggling to detox an amount of remains. Feathering has 
    begun to occur upon the walls of the cells, from digestion, a collection of digested species in chains have accumulated into Rabies. When does Rabies become human? Let's take a look.</p>
    <h3>Microscopic Human Remains</h3>
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Morphological-changes-such-as-detachments-and-dead-cells-were-observed-in-HeLa-cells_fig2_322273091"><img src="dead_human_cells.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Micrographs of Human Cells Dying</figcaption>
    <p>Above, we can see that these human cells have begun to die. Their shapes, like diamond webbing, become granular and dissonant, collapsing in space. The shapes of the 
    human cells reflect that of the shapes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_XU0HTkLU">Glycoproteins found along Rabies Cells</a>. Glycoproteins are embedded as 
    a part, sourcing in growth, from a cell. This means that the glycoproteins found in the majority of cases of Rabies, include human flesh. This links Rabies as a diagnosis for 
    human remains contamination, in source, what looks like, mixed within ground beef from a factory.</p>
