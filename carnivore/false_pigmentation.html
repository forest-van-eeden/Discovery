    <h1>False Pigmentation</h1>
    <p>This practice, False Pigmentation, has gone on for what can be observed as centuries, going unknown in occurrance. It is a dangerous 
    practice, having any reasons or needs for the practice being expunged, and resulting in ailments.</p>
    <h2>False Pigmentation Breakage</h2>
    <p>After a long time discovering the best options for her hair to be naturally cared for, and to grow, 
    Forest found that she is, actually, naturally platinum, diamond blonde and that her hair was being False Pigmented dark, somehow. 
    This discovery led to her understanding that she needs to bleach out unnatural, False Pigment from her hair, in order to 
    have a natural experience in life.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, looking to see the negative effects from the False Pigmentation, she could begin to recognise that the 
    False Pigmenting, from an unknown source and person(s), was causing ailment, particularly breakage. Skin damage, hair 
    damage, and internal damage, were all results of her being unnaturally False Pigmented. Her hair began to weaken in places 
    where unnaturally False Pigmented (inked), causing breakages in her hair, after further re-applications of ink, by person(s).</p>
    <p>Forest is not sure who is inking her hair or why they are doing it. Many times, she witnesses some issues such as the 
    acceptance of the inking practice by others as forms of "preservation" of her hair, as if it is a form of "security". 
    The accumulating evidence, suggests already, that it is ailing to have any inking, whatsoever, on anyone's body, a practice 
    to apply such substances as that of taking advantage of a rate of ability to heal one's self for entertainment.</p>
    <p>She finds that it is more dangerous to cloak one's natural, organic, appearance, than to be presently one's self. 
    Others may not understand or will misunderstand who a cloaked person is, causing the possibility of treatment towards that 
    person such as that of another, natural protection of or from that person such as that of another.</p>
    <p>Breakage does occur from False Pigmentation, having fatigued follicles and hair shafts from the process of detoxing 
    the pigments out of the body, resulting into breakage or hair loss, with an inability to repair the hair prior to a next 
    False Pigmenting occurrance.</p>
    <h2>False Pigmentation Poisoning</h2>
    <p>Conditions beginning from inking start with False Pigmentation Poisoning. Over a long amount of time, and much inking, 
    poisoning can occur within the person being inked. Any form of unnatural False Pigmentation, (fake tan, tinting, ink, henna), 
    can lead to False Pigmentation Poisoning in amounts, prolonged, such as this. Removal Chemicals are then required for those 
    individuals, suffering from False Pigmentation Poisoning, in order to detox out the unnatural False Pigments, not belonging and causing 
    ailment within their bodies, causing disability to an extent.</p>
    <h3>Removal Chemical Damage</h3>
    <p>Depending on the level of natural hierarchy in the origins of the inked person, (where they are from, where their 
    family's minerals exist), this is the maximum level of Removal Chemical that can be withstood, by the inked person, 
    prior to breakage, ailment, or chemical burning from Removal Chemicals.</p>
    <p>Forest, for instance, struggles to find bleach strong enough to cleanse her hair all of the way, needing salts originating from the 
    place on Earth with the purest minerals (Voorne Putten, NL), that are rarely available for import, or are at too high of 
    an expense for her aquirement. She struggles to get her hair back close to her natural state, for those reasons.</p>
    <h3>Cancer Toxicity</h3>
    <p>In reference to the <a href="cancer.html" target="_blank">Cancer document</a>, under the Carnivore category, it can 
    be seen that there is some form of inking that has occurred in the images of Alopecia. Inking can slow down the process 
    of healing forms of Cancer, such as Alopecia, and it can also be seen needing to be detoxed out of the body, by cells, 
    making it a causing factor for what I have termed, here, as False Pigmentation Poisoning.</p>
    <p>Other forms of False Pigmentation, such as tattooing, can also be toxic at high volumes, over time, tattoos needing to naturally 
    detoxify out of the body over time.</p>
    <h2>Recognition Failure</h2>
    <p>The dangers now caused by False Pigmenting or inking, now, reside within the loss of recognition or the ability for a person 
    to complete their purpose in life, by just being. When the body has been occluded in False Pigmentations, or obscured in certain 
    cloaking methods or messages, others witnessing the Inked or False Pigmented person face the danger of mistaking a healer, for instance, as a threat. 
    </p>
    <p>Not only could someone, such as a healer in life, be mistaken as a threat, but they can no longer heal others by being witnessed 
    by others, healing would, then, need to become a totally physical interaction with the healer, requiring more work from the 
    healer than they may have available, in their state of health from False Pigmentation Poisoning.</p>
    <p>Forest finds that her organic tones and colours are reflective in a healing way, but when obscured with False Pigments, they 
    share suffering and pain, that she is experiencing, as a request for help from others. Thus, any sorts of processes 
    enforcing the work of False Pigmentation, are extremely inorganic and dangerous in Nature and in Conservation, leading to 
    extreme, deadly, malnourishment for many reasons.</p>
    <blockquote>Forest van Eeden: "I can sit in the direct sunlight with the highest level hair bleach on my hair, from England, 
    all day, and I still struggle to get the False Pigments out of my hair all of the way. I can mix British Dettol in the hair 
    bleach that I have, and it still isn't enough to get my body back."</blockquote>
