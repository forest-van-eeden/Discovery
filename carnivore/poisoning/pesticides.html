    <h1>Pesticides</h1>
    <p>Pesticides can cause Jaundice when inhaled in the home. They can cause yellowing of the breath resulting in Jaundice, Rabies, 
      N-Contamination, Cancer, and fatalities from these conditions. Insects suffering from Pesticides may, also, cause these symptoms 
    in their attempt to heal conditions including remains, where they are proficient in aiding with work in wildlife populations, 
    effectively treating Rabies.</p>
    <h2>Inhumane Nature</h2>
    <p>The qualities in pesticides that are inhumane are from the amount of Remains' Fluids that are used to produce them. This act 
    calls the healing insects to treat the situation, naturally, being how they are in life, and then they are numbed with a numbing 
    agent while they burn to death from heavy metal and levels of explosive minerals.</p>
