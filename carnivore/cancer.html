        <h1>Cancer</h1>
        <p>Cancer is caused by a variety of issues 
        relating to forms of growth, or causing forms of 
        improper growth. These can be related to animal 
        food, mineral food, insect food, milk, or semen.
        </p>
        <h2>Reasoning, Evidence, and Explanation</h2>
        <h3>Organic Decay Consumption</h3>
        <p>Plants are the natural, and organic (in terms of <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Conservation/Boem/conservation/natural_conservation/organic_conservation/organic_beholding/organic_preservation/organic_preservation-description.html" target="_blank">Organic Preservation</a>), species to 
            consume decay matter. These forms of matter include 
            any form of dead bodies, such as: dead animals, dead 
            humans, dead insects, dead fish, dead mammals, dead reptiles, 
            or any other form of dead flesh.</p>
        <p>The practice of eating meat began in times 
            of famine, when no plants were remaining 
            to eat. From there, sacrificial cultures 
            began to eat meat in order to appeal to 
            some form of higher power, creating delicacy 
            within meat eating practices, worshiping the 
            practice itself. Since then, meat eating has become 
            a normalised part of human culture and decreed as 
            the only food for their cats and dogs.</p>
        <h2>Microscopic Analysis</h2>
        <p>When meat is consumed, or milk, that is not 
            compatible in growth with the body, such as that 
            of the incorrect female or a different species, Cancer 
            begins to form. Semen that is incompatible within 
            growth in the body can, also, cause this Cancerous 
            growth.</p>
        <p>Many of these processes begin to develop in forms of 
            Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) or Alopecia Areata (Balding). 
            Beginning with these signs, tumors can begin to accumulate 
            with further consumption of the causing factors.</p>
        <h3>Alopecia</h3>
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201711" target="_blank"><img src="alopecia.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Alopecia Growth</figcaption>
        <p>Above, we can see that Alopecia is a collection of 
            "malgrowth" that causes clogged pores, resulting in a loss 
            of hair growth. This is the beginning of Cancer developing 
        under the skin, and through. What, then, tends to occur is a clogging of 
        blood vessels leading to those areas. This is, a bit, further of an advanced 
        stage of Cancer than is Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor), which is 
        what we will see, below.</p>
        <p>What we can see, above, is a progression of images, starting from the "alopeciated" follicle in question and observation, 
        exemplifying the detail of Alopecia in its accumulation. In (A), we see the alopeciated pore, where hair grows, thickened 
        by some form of growth. In (B), we see samples of the hairs growing in the area of "alopeciation", exemplifying a buildup 
            on the follicle portion near the bottom. In (C), we see a mixture of cellular issues; what looks like pigmented cells 
        in the process of detox, inflammed follicular cells post-removal of hair, and a fatty type of cell that is building up 
        and stretching out the areas of where we can recognise the pigmented cells are meant to stand. These are forms of deformation, 
        or malgrowth, caused by some of the toxins that we will take a look at, further below, in this document. Lastly, in (D), we 
        begin to recognise the extent of malformation occurring in the fatty deposits, within the Alopecia, pushing out and stretching out 
        the helper cells that would be detoxing pigments in a streamlined fashion. The pinker hues here are showcasing the struggling connections 
        occurring subcutaneously, to pull out and expel out the fatty builds.</p>
        <h3>Pityriasis Versicolor</h3>
        <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/911138-workup" target="_blank"><img src="pityriasis_versicolor.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor)</figcaption>
        <p>Pityriasis Versicolor, or Tinea Versicolor, is the beginning stage of Cancer, that we will have a look 
        at. What occurs, here, is that there is a discoloration beginning to form under the skin, showing apparent 
        growth that is occurring subcutaneously. From this point, Alopecia begins to form as internal blockages 
        develop and accumulate.</p>
        <p>When we are looking at fatty builds and how these sorts of areas may begin to arise, Pityriasis Versicolor 
        is a good example for us to see what this all looks like, at a cellular level. While commonly notated as a form 
        of fungus, this fungus builds and grows up based on the presence of fatty cells, Cancer cells. This micellar network 
        gains a presence as a bodily, and organic, response for a need to break down Cancerous growth occurring as fatty cells. 
        When we consider what is the internal build of a fatty, Cancer, cell, it is simply a contamination from carnivorous factors,
         as we can begin to learn from the Organic Decay Consumption section, above.</p>
        <p>Here, in  Pityriasis Versicolor, these cellular sections are at the point of attack from the fungal network, pulling it 
        down into the digestion system, to detoxify its presence out. When we consider medicines for Pityriasis Versicolor, we can 
        begin to recognise the incorporation of sages, and other forms of detoxifying botany. What these botanical solutions aim to 
        accomplish, is to break up and process out the formations that result in building eponychium. When these cellular structures 
        are built to begin to be formed with material, or matter, that is no longer that of the person's, Cancer is the result. This is 
        why it is imperative for Vegan diets to be maintained, since they do not contain such forms of toxins.</p>
        
        <h3>Cancer</h3>
        <a href="https://www.goldenstatedermatology.com/blog/what-does-skin-cancer-look-like-under-a-microscope/" target="_blank"><img src="skin_cancer.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Skin Cancer</figcaption>
        <p>When we are looking at Cancer, as a whole, we can begin to decipher the complexities building it, as different fat globules. 
            We can see in the image, above, that Skin Cancer doesn't look so different from Alopecia or Pityriasis Versicolor. 
            Instead, we can recognise that it is, actually, more similar to the two than any other form of ailment. This begins to 
            give us a full scope of what we are dealing with, and what we are looking at. These fat globules, in Skin Cancer, are various toxins, 
            (explained below), that build up; beginning with Pityriasis Versicolor, extenuating into Alopecia, finally, built into Skin Cancer: leading to tumorous forms of Cancer. 
            These stages of Cancer Development are what build up to, what we can, also, hope to see as, stages of Cancer Detoxification.
        </p>
        <p>Let's take a further look at what some of these toxins look like, under a microscope, to finalise our comparison.</p>
        <h3>Toxins</h3>
        <p>When we are looking at these toxins, for the first time, we can begin to build a skill of recognition. This skill 
        allows us to look at each of these, separately, and to begin to see what causes exist, where. We can also, then, begin 
        to recognise what commonalities and connections they all have to one another, their similarities.</p>
        <h4>Human Milk</h4>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/13f52jf/my_breastmilk_under_a_microscope/" target="_blank"><img src="human_milk.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Human Milk</figcaption>
        <p>This image of human milk, being microscopically photographed, shows us a gradient of detail, less from left and more 
        from right. When we look at the third from left image, we begin to recognise the commonalities of all of these Cancerous 
        causing toxins, fat. When this milk is not given to its correct receiver, it will cause fat, an instance of growth outside 
        of the body's normal, a malformation from a build up of these toxins. While they are commonly eaten and drank, they are not 
        causing health, but instead, causing this malformation leading to Cancer recognition.</p>
        <p>The fatty globules can accumulate, together, in intake, and build upon one another to form their designed structure. 
        While this is what they exist to do, it is not compatible with each and every body, such as: not each gas is easily breathed. 
        Building up, together, we begin to see larger globules coalesce into spheres of larger proportions, as is recognisable on 
            the furthest left slide of the image, above. Their forms finding rest as they coalesce into shape, growing the original 
        source, from whence they came, a human woman, one, of specification.</p>
        <h4>Cow's Milk</h4>
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Scanning-electron-microscopy-of-lyophilized-samples-of-milk-a-milk-sample-that-was_fig2_301601653" target="_blank"><img src="cow_milk.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Cow's Milk</figcaption>
        <p>The cow's milk is similar in these means. While this image doesn't contain the detail and resolution of the 
        human milk's snapshots, we can recognise the same globule shape contained. These globules, then, begin to form 
        the cow's bones, for her male counterpart's strengthening. Leading into fertility and crossbreeding studies, these matches 
        are one of a kind. Staying here, to continue on with our Cancer recognition analysis, we see that these bone structures are 
        not compatible with all bodies, especially of differing species, which can lead to malgrowth and malformation, Cancer.</p>
        <p>To grow a cow within a human child, would result in "hooving", an issue where legaments begin to form hoof shaped bones,
         and other forms of enlargements and weight gain. These forms of cancer, while taking certain common averages in human 
        expectations, do, in fact, form Cancer. Tumors can develop as organ shapes are not matching the type of milk given, provided, or 
        consumed.</p>
        <p>Further along in these types of studies, we begin to recognise the prolonged effects of prehistoric, jurassic, and other eras 
        of dinosaur milk, meat, and semen consumption, malforming and misshaping the human body into primate forms, where Veganism is 
        decreed law. Let's take one last look, here, at human semen and how this fits into our fat globule formations' starts.</p>
        <h4>Human Semen</h4>
        <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-sperm-morphology-stain-under-microscope-at-100x-inmersion-oil-objetive-16577859.html?imageid=76FD502F-C259-49CD-9DEA-E659B4B2DBFF&pn=1&searchId=cc7fe9e686fe9af763b5bbabf4347f86&searchtype=0" target="_blank"><img src="human_semen.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Human Semen</figcaption>
        <p>This semen, is human, as we can decipher, as it relates to the meaning for "fertility of a couple" (its original prescribed mission). 
        We begin to see different shapes in this slide. We see shapes of sperm, the original focus, here. We see shapes of red or pink, insinuating 
        a release of cellular groups relating to blood and tissue development. Lastly, we see white Pāhoehoe-esque flows, echoing flows of 
        those such as the milks, above, patterns seen in the marrows of bone.</p>
        <p>Let's focus on the Pāhoehoe flows, here, the white bone globules. These bone globules grow bone into one specifically 
        compatible female, for this male, in particular. Only one body can compatibly accept this form of growth, for this male,
         in the terms of fertility, provided. Here, arises our problem of Cancerous growth. If this semen's bone globules were to 
        meet, and grow, within an incompatible host (another of some kind), it would cause incompatible growth. While we cannot look 
        at compatible styles of growth, here, in public viewing, at the moment, we can begin to recognise this form of compatibility 
        in nature.</p>
        <p>Fat globules aside, the strong and fit have this sense of compatibility in their growth, and we can all ask, "How did you 
        get so fit?" Perhaps we will hear of how God brought together a wife and husband, perhaps an echoing mating call from a perfect, 
        anomalous, partner; either way, it seems to be a miraculous courtship that brings together these perfect matches, of which we have 
        no need to worry about.</p>
        <h4>Shellfish and Marine Life</h4>
        <p>Examples of shelled fish are shrimp, sea snails, mussels, oysters, clams, crabs, lobsters, and other forms of marine 
        life having shells or exoskeletons. The behaviour that we see that has developed as the physical abilities of these 
        creatures is that of a twisting manner of internal thought, feeling, expression, and being. What this results in is a 
        form of twisting of experience of being within the human body and other bodies that have toxins from these forms of marine 
        life. When they feel threatened, or unsafe, they begin to harden for protection. So, thus, having these forms of toxins 
        in the body can result in their hardening upon those sorts of feelings. This makes it quite difficult to detox. Other issues 
        of hardening come from the act of hiding, as well.</p>
        <p>When cancer is found to be hardened, in the body, it is likely to be from a mixture of toxins originating from these 
        forms of marine life. This is why a Vegan diet is imperative to maintain and that any form of Manganese consumption only 
        originates from sediments released from these sorts of wildlife through their entire digestion process, as alive.</p>
        <p>Some images of cancerous tumors reveal growths of fish inside of the body, as well. It is not easy to digest out the 
        growth and ability to regrow, of fish. Marine Life are especially gifted in regeneration of lost limbs, fins, and other 
        forms of parts. This includes larger marine animals, like dolphins, sharks, and whales. It is extremely dangerous to eat 
        marine life that is not a plant form. On land, we must continue to eat only those forms of marine plants that are available 
        to us, not anything deep sea, either.</p>
        <h4>Shelled Eggs, Reptiles, and Avian Life</h4>
        <p>Another form of hardening of interal tumourous cancers can orginate from the consumption of Shelled Eggs. Symptoms such as 
        crusting, dandriff, peeling, balding, and other forms of flaking of the skin, develop from consumption of these forms of life. Other 
        symptoms can be such as that of marine life consumption, hardening, avian formation, and such. It has been witnessed that 
        the consumption of chicken eggs can result in the internal growth of an actual chicken, within the body (Computed Tomography).</p>
        <p>While it is uncommon to see forms of consumption of reptiles, in modern day systemization, it is still possible to have as an 
        issue. These forms of intoxication are similar to that of marine life. They have high abilities to regenerate their bodies, being 
        dangerous inside of a foreign body. Their venomous salivas are a result of a lack of clean water, with generational forms of remains 
        built in their cultures.</p>
        <h4>Insects and Shelled Land Creatures</h4>
        <p>Insects are designed to detox other animals and life. The mosquito, for instance, is nature's blood drawer, sitting on their 
        patients, filtering their blood as an aid to their body. While they do carry forms of illness, from this work, around, it is meant 
        to help life to network together to solve problems.</p>
        <p>Eating these creatures, or their honey, can result in growth to become such as them. It is, also, dangerous. They remove remains, 
        rabies, and other illnesses from toxicities in the environment. They, also, clean water and other fluids in the environment. What 
        can be expected to be seen from consuming them is such as that of Shellfish. Hardening, when threatened or unsafe, is a high possibility, 
        especially from those such as snails or slugs. Slugs leave hard residues behind as they cover the earth, which disintigrates gently 
        as it hardens. Honey forms calcification for many different purposes, mostly protection for a community or family.</p>
        <h4>Dinosaur Remains</h4>
        <p>Forms of remains, existing generationally in families, originating from dinosaurs that are no longer in those forms, having 
        bred into marine life or other animals, must be detoxed. Different forms of malformation can occur as a result of these remains, 
        whether it be milk, egg, semen, or flesh. The size of those creatures begins to develop in the body, and is passed down generationally. 
        They must go out, in a high priority manner of detoxing.</p>
        <p>They can alter perceptions of all of the senses to be extremely "out of body" and painful to experience, causing great suffering 
        in life.</p>
        <h4>Rodents and Bats</h4>
        <p>Rodent and Bat consumption can cause highly toxic contamination and rabies. Their species will malform the body to develop 
        traits such as their's, bucking teeth, and those sorts of issues. Extended nervous damage can occur, and forms of bugging, as well.</p>
        <h4>Hooved Life</h4>
        <p>Hoofing is a term, we are using here, to describe the malformation from the consumption of hooved life. Deer, Cows, Horses, 
        Antelope, Sheep, Goats, Pigs, and others all have hooves as feet and some have clefted lips. Their consumption can cause malformation of the body 
        into those forms. Consuming their milk can cause conditions such as Clubfoot, or Cleft Palate in pregnancy, and infants, as well.</p>
        <h4>Felines and Canines</h4>
        <p>These species are more predator. Any consumption of their flesh or fluids can lead to severe forms of <a href="rabies/rabies.html">Rabies</a>. 
        Many of them rely on meat diets for quite some time. Forms of malformation into their bodies' form can occur.</p>
        <h4>Marsupials</h4>
        <p>The consumption of marsupials leads into cannibalism. These are creatures that are close in relation to human kind and any of 
        their remains should be detoxed.</p>
        <h4>Primates</h4>
        <p>Primates are early human beings. They are a part of humanity. They have many forms of malgrowth, that can extend to extremes 
        in malformation of the teeth, body, neck, head, behind, hands, feet, and spine. They are mostly kept as Vegan, in captivity, but 
        should be detoxed if remains are consumed, being a form of cannibalism.</p>
        <h4>Cannibalism</h4>
        <p>When human remains are consumed, this is called cannibalism. While it can occur accidently, from machinery or wound care, 
        these sorts of remains lead to extreme issues, when consumed. Many psychological, sociological, or communitative issues can 
        arise from this form of consumption, as well as malformations that develop at a high rate.</p>
        <p>Transplanting organs are also within this range. Those organs need to regrow in that place of the transplanted organ from 
        the origination of the patient having the organ.</p>
        <h2>Detoxing</h2>
        <p>Detoxing these forms of cancer is possible. While sever forms of this cancer is extreme suffering, expecially detoxing it, 
        we have new means to do this at a doable rate. This rate is that of Organic Preservation.</p>
        <h3>Meditations</h3>
        <p>These are thinking exercises that will help in the detoxing process.</p>
        <h4>Organic Preservation</h4>
        <p>Beginning this process, it is good to go through a prayerful time with God. Giving yourself totally to God, in faith, will 
        ease the amount of worry that is experienced during these processes. You are not alone, God is always with you.</p>
        <p>Once you are ready, you can begin to consider the idea of "Organic Preservation". Organic Preservation is the process of 
        preserving life to be alive. You can begin to do things in a way that is preserving your life to be alive.</p>
        <h4>I am safe to live</h4>
        <p>For many different hardening kinds of species, it is needed to understand that you are safe, in order to soften them for detoxing. 
        Remembering "I am safe to live", especially with the knowledge that God is protecting you, will give you the freedom to release those 
        remains, out of your body. It is very helpful to remember, "I am safe to live", on the toilet. For us, we can live without shellfish 
        fluids and remains in our bodies. These remains will turn into fluids.</p>
        <h4>Let it happen</h4>
        <p>Remembering to "let it happen", helps when things are moving around or changing in the body. Let the remains leave your body. 
        Let your body change in its needs. Let yourself get better. Let things happen around you that are out of your control. You are safe, 
        let it happen. God will take care of you.</p>
        <h4>It is now in <u>your</u> body</h4>
        <p>Remembering "it is now in my body" is helpful to release and relieve the fear that it is believing it is in a body where it belongs. 
        Knowing that "it is now in my body" about the remains helps to change its behaviours and growth to go out of your body. Knowing that 
        is in the wrong body, is helpful here, so that it knows that it must go.</p>
        <h4>Releasing them back to God</h4>
        <p>Grieving the loss of the life that has been consumed is a good practice. While not needing to extensively grieve and harm yourself 
        for it, keeping a somber feeling about the presence of remains in you is helpful to respectfully release them out of your body. 
        By releasing them out of your body, through your digestion processes, you are able to release them back to God. God can work wonders 
        in restoring species, we pray that God can when we let them go.</p>
        <h4>Keep Going</h4>
        <p>Remember to "Keep Going", it helps when you feel overwhelmed or stuck.</p>
        <h3>Activities and Practices</h3>
        <p>Activities are supportive in being different ways of detoxing, giving variation that may be needed, making it an easier process.</p>
        <h4>Relaxation</h4>
        <p>With hardening remains, it is easy to allow the fluids that make their shells to soften, soften, by refraining from protecting 
        and making things with the fluids (like out of your spit, urine, or soil) as if from the fluids. Shelled creatures make shells with their 
        fluids that are small in size, like sand, for different purposes. Refrain from doing what they do with relaxation.</p>
        <p>Refrain from hard labour, as well, that can be tempting to use the hardening remains to strengthen you, rather than giving them 
        an ease to go out of your body. Giving them usage keeps them inside of your body. The malgrowth may take you in foreign ways, but 
        that is the distance that you need to go to get it out.</p>
        <h4>Grooming</h4>
        <p>Try not to cut your nails or hair, during intense times of detoxing. This can cause confusion in your body to need to grow more, 
        keeping some remains present that are hardening. Dying your hair with pigments is, also, not a good idea. Pigments that are unnatural 
        to you will slow down the detoxing abilities that your body has.</p>
        <p>Letting toothpaste rest on your teeth or in your mouth for a time is, also, a good practice for the release of growth in the mouth, 
        neck, face, and jaw. Enduring the pain of the "break up" will be an ability that is valuable to gain.</p>
        <p>You can help blood flow by taking a warm shower or bath, while not being afraid of the heat. This will help to soften remains 
        so that they flow out of the body.</p>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Gentle exercises are good for detoxing these toxins. Walking and stretching are some of the best options. Elevating the feet
