        <h1>Cancer</h1>
        <p>Cancer is caused by a variety of issues 
        relating to forms of growth or causing forms of 
        improper growth. These can be related to animal 
        food, mineral food, insect food, milk, or semen.
        </p>
        <h2>Reasoning</h2>
        <h3>Organic Decay Consumption</h3>
        <p>Plants are the natural and organic species to 
            consume decay matter. These forms of matter include 
            any form of dead bodies such as, dead animals, dead 
            humans, dead insects, dead fish, dead mammals, dead reptiles, 
            or any other form of dead flesh.</p>
        <p>The practice of eating meat began in times 
            of famine, when no plants were remaining 
            to eat. From there, sacrificial cultures 
            began to eat meat in order to appeal to 
            some form of higher power, creating delicacy 
            within meat eating practices, worshiping the 
            practice itself. Since then, meat eating has become 
            a normalised part of human culture and decreed as 
            the only food for their cats and dogs.</p>
        <h2>Microscopic Analysis</h2>
        <p>When meat is consumed or milk that is not 
            compatible in growth with the body, such as that 
            of the incorrect female or a different species, cancer 
            begins to form. Semen that is incompatible with 
            in growth in the body can, also, cause this cancerous 
            growth.</p>
        <p>Many of these processes begin to develop in forms of 
            Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) or Alopecia Areata (Balding). 
            Beginning with these signs, tumors can begin to accumulate 
            with further consumption of the causing factors.</p>
        <h3>Alopecia</h3>

        <p>Above, we can see that alopcia is a collection of 
            "malgrowth" that causes clogged pores, resulting in a loss 
            of hair growth.</p>
