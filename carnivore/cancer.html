        <h1>Cancer</h1>
        <p>Cancer is caused by a variety of issues 
        relating to forms of growth or causing forms of 
        improper growth. These can be related to animal 
        food, mineral food, insect food, milk, or semen.
        </p>
        <h2>Reasoning</h2>
        <h3>Organic Decay Consumption</h3>
        <p>Plants are the natural and organic species to 
            consume decay matter. These forms of matter include 
            any form of dead bodies such as, dead animals, dead 
            humans, dead insects, dead fish, dead mammals, dead reptiles, 
            or any other form of dead flesh.</p>
        <p>The practice of eating meat began in times 
            of famine, when no plants were remaining 
            to eat. From there, sacrificial cultures 
            began to eat meat in order to appeal to 
            some form of higher power, creating delicacy 
            within meat eating practices, worshiping the 
            practice itself. Since then, meat eating has become 
            a normalised part of human culture and decreed as 
            the only food for their cats and dogs.</p>
        <h2>Microscopic Analysis</h2>
        <p>When meat is consumed or milk that is not 
            compatible in growth with the body, such as that 
            of the incorrect female or a different species, cancer 
            begins to form. Semen that is incompatible with 
            in growth in the body can, also, cause this cancerous 
            growth.</p>
        <p>Many of these processes begin to develop in forms of 
            Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor) or Alopecia Areata (Balding). 
            Beginning with these signs, tumors can begin to accumulate 
            with further consumption of the causing factors.</p>
        <h3>Alopecia</h3>
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201711"><img src="alopecia.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Alopecia Growth</figcaption>
        <p>Above, we can see that alopcia is a collection of 
            "malgrowth" that causes clogged pores, resulting in a loss 
            of hair growth. This is the beginning of cancer developing 
        under the skin, and through. What then tends to occur is a clogging of 
        blood vessels leading to those areas. This is a bit further of an advanced 
        stage of cancer than is Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor), which is 
        what we will see below.</p>
        <p>What we can see above, is a progression of images, starting from the alopecated follicle in question and observation, 
        exemplifying the detail of alopecia in its accumulation. In (A), we see the alopecated pore, where hair grows, thickened 
        by some form of growth. In (B), we see samples of the hairs growing in the area of alopeciation, exemplifying a buildup 
            on the follicle portion near the bottom. In (C), we see a mixture of cellular issues; what looks like pigmented cells 
        in the process of detox, inflammed follicular cells post-removal of hair, and a fatty type of cell that is building up 
        and stretching out the areas of where we can recognise the pigmented cells are meant to stand. These are forms of deformation 
        or malgrowth caused by some of the toxins that we will take a look at further below in this document. Lastly, in (D), we 
        begin to recognise the extent of malformation occurring in the fatty deposits within the alopecia, pushing out and stretching out 
        the helper cells that would be detoxing pigments in a streamlined fashion. The pinker hues here are showcasing the struggling connections 
        occurring subcutaneously, to pull out and expel out the fatty builds.</p>
        <h3>Pityriasis Versicolor</h3>
        <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/911138-workup"><img src="pityriasis_versicolor.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Pityriasis Versicolor (Tinea Versicolor)</figcaption>
        <p>Pityriasis Versicolor, or Tinea Versicolor, is the beginning stage of cancer, that we will have a look 
        at. What occurs here is that there is a discoloration beginning to form under the skin, showing apparent 
        growth that is occurring subcutaneously. From this point, Alopecia begins to form as internal blockages 
        develop and accumulate.</p>
        <p>When we are looking at fatty builds and how these sorts of areas may begin to arise, Pityriasis Versicolor 
        is a good example for us to see what this all looks like at a cellular level. While commonly notated as a form 
        of fungus, this fungus builds and grows up based on the presence of fatty cells, cancer cells. This micellar network 
        gains a presence as a bodily and organic response for a need to break down cancerous growth occurring as fatty cells. 
        When we consider what is the internal build of a fatty, cancer, cell, it is simply a contamination from carnivorous factors,
         as we can begin to learn from the Organic Decay Consumption section, above.</p>
        <p>Here, in  Pityriasis Versicolor, these cellular sections are at the point of attack from the fungal network, pulling it 
        down into the digestion system, to detoxify its presence out. When we consider medicines for Pityriasis Versicolor, we can 
        begin to recognise the incorporation of sages and other forms of detoxifying botany. What these botanical solutions aim to 
        accomplish, is to break up and process out the formations that result in building eponychium. When these cellular structures 
        are built to begin to be formed with material or matter that is no longer that of the person's, cancer is the result. This is 
        why it is imperative for Vegan diets to be maintained, since they do not contain such forms of toxins.</p
        <p>Let's take a further look at what some of these toxins look like under a microscope to finalise our comparison.</p>
        <h3>Toxins</h3>
        <p>When we are looking at these toxins for the first time, we can begin to build a skill of recognition. This skill 
        allows us to look at each of these separately and to begin to see what causes exist where. We can also, then, begin 
        to recognise what commonalities and connections they all have to one another, their similarities.</p>
        <h4>Human Milk</h4>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/13f52jf/my_breastmilk_under_a_microscope/"><img src="human_milk.jpeg"></a>
        <figcaption>Microscopic Images of Human Milk</figcaption>
        <p>This image of human milk, being microscopically photographed, shows us a gradient of detail, less from left and more 
        from right. When we look at the third from left image, we begin to recognise the commonalities of all of these cancerous 
        causing toxins, fat. When this milk is not given to its correct receiver, it will cause fat, an instance of growth outside 
        of the body's norm, a malformation from a build up of these toxins. While they are commonly eaten and drank, they are not 
        causing health, but instead, causing this malformation leading to cancer recognition.</p>
        <p>The fatty globules can accumulate together, in intake, and build upon one another to form their designed structure. 
        While this is what they exist to do, it is not compatible with each and every body, such as not each gas is easily breathed. 
        Building up, together, we begin to see larger globules coalesce into spheres of larger proportions, as is recognisable on 
            the furthest left slide of the image above. Their forms finding rest as they coalesce into shape, growing the original 
        source from which they came, a human woman, one, of specification.</p>
