    <h1>Infinity</h1>
    <p>Outside of Boem, we are inside of Infinity, a being like a dragon of 
    infinite reality. Infinity had an injury occur to him. He was bitten by 
    another of his kind, having a sort of disease like Rabies. Where we 
    are in Infinity was torn off of his body, his tail to be exact.</p>
    <p>These things came to be known to me after I painted this, below.</p>

    <p>What I was painting was an act of worship, expressing my feelings to 
    and about God by painting, simply, God's body. Once my dot series was 
    impressed, I stood back at the collage, having hung it on the corner of my 
    wall, fitting perfectly there, and I witnessed what was the actuality of 
    our existence here, Infinity's injury. It was so like a map that I had 
    painted.</p>
    <p>After further questioning to the Heavenly bodies, it was confirmed to 
    me to be true. The corner within the body of Infinity, in the painting, 
    is where we are.</p>
