    <h1>N-Contamination</h1>
    <p>N-Contamination stands for Nuclear Contamination. Although there are different stages of this illness, 
      being radioactive, in nature, it does source itself from Nuclear Waste or Nuclear Exposure. <br><br>
      Covid, Uranium poisoning, and Lyme Disease are all forms of N-Contamination. This disease is airborne.</p>

    <p>Above, we can see N-Dodecane, a Nuclear Preservative, after being injected in PE Particles, a form of plastic. The resulting image, on the right of the pair,
     demonstrates the remaining effect, after N-Dodecane's removal. While it is not necessarily any form of poison, on its own, it begins to pull charges from 
    nuclear sources, including household electricity.</p>

    </div>
    <p>This image, above, shows the color match between N-Dodecane and Lyme Disease, proving that Lyme Disease is a form of Microbial Infection of N-Dodecane.
     This means that Bacteria and Microbial Species get contaminated with N-Dodecane, and this forms what is deteced as Lyme Disease. These Microbial 
    Species are in the process of detoxing, this electrical agent, out of the body.</p>

      <figcaption>Transmission Electron Microscopic Image of SARS-CoV-2</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>SARS-CoV-2 is termed as a virus that causes COVID-19. In actuality, we are witnessing human cells, carrying this microbial infection of N-Dodecane, as 
    can be recognised from the same colour glow, around the cells, that is seen in the first two images. We are also witnessing, here, a form of electrical charge, 
    causing a patternistic separation of the N-Dodecane, upon the human cells. This can be caused by several different electrical components, existing in 
    Wifi Devices, Cellular Devices, Remote Technology, and other forms of Signal Emitting Devices, or Structures.</p>
    <p>In this understanding, the decaying factor is the level of electrical charge in the environment. The Orange/Yellow color within the circle of N-Dodecane is
     an indicator that the N-Dodecane is causing inflamation, from a burning type of effect, that the Local Charges are producing.</p>

    <p>These cells, shown above, are fat cells that are in the process of burning. This image can serve as an example, here, to extend our understanding of what the
     SARS-CoV-2 cells are experiencing. The Orange/Beige ring, indicates a burning process is occuring, while, the red center, indicates extreme inflammation, from
     experiencing this burning process.</p>

    <p>Finally, we can comprehend the look of N-Dodecane, in a burning process, with the above image. This image shows a droplet of N-Dodecane, in the process of 
    Ignition and Extinction. The N-Dodecane combusts, in the images, and then extinguishes with a flame. What this can teach us, for N-Contamination, is that the 
    N-Dodecane is, in fact, burning the human cells, in the image of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
    <h2>N-Contamination Treatment</h2>
    <p>Over the counter, there are options for this sort of Contamination, thankfully. Forest van Eeden has put together a treatment plan, below, in order to 
    care for those needing this support.</p>
    <h3>Forest's Treatment Plan</h3>
    <h4>1. Nabacterosis</h4>
    <p>Please check to make sure that you do not have Nabacterosis, before this treatment. Without bacteria in your body, it will not work. 
    You cannot be on antibiotics, or anything of that nature, that is anti-bacterial. Nabacterosis is a condition where you are lacking proficient 
    bacterial varieties, in your body. They help to detox N-Dodecane, during this process.</p>
    <h4>2. Alcohol</h4>
    <p>There is, absolutely, no alcohol, of any kind, allowed in this detox. Alcohol is flammable and will fuel the nuclear contamination, 
      causing severe internal burns. Alcohol is prohibited.</p>
    <h4>3. De-jewel</h4>
    <p>Before this process begins, you will need to remove as much jewelry, as is physically possible. Many, and most metals in jewellery, are conductive 
      and will only draw energy, or radiation, when worn or used. We want to avoid this, so either, put on a plastic ring, or put the luxury aside, while you get 
      on with your bog water journey.</p>
    <h4>4. Digital Detox</h4>
    <p>
      At the beginning, of your treatment, you will need to begin to adjust your lifestyle, in order to minimize your electrical usage. We call this a Digital Detox.<br><br>
Make an effort to stay active, in the type of light, that you need to be able to see, during the day, or night, minimising electrical light usage, and devices, as much as is 
      physically possible. If you have the authority to turn off your wifi, and unplug your router, in your home, when you are not using it, then it is recommended to do so, 
      as well. Any type of electrical device, during your cool-down, especially the beginning to middle parts, will be best unplugged, and turned off, or you risk recharging 
      your N-Contaminants with Nuclear Energy.<br><br>
This includes Electric Stoves and Ovens. Please try to cook on a gas stove, or gas camping stove, while Digital Detoxing, and on your treatment.
    </p>
    <h4>5. Sun Shy Time</h4>
    <p>While you are in your Digital Detox, it is also recommended, to stay out of the Sunlight, where possible. 
      N-Contaminants can, also, be charged by sunlight energy.</p>
    <h4>6. Plastics and Silicons</h4>
    <p>If you have plastic, or silicon, in your body, you are going to have to detox,and remove, all of those things, during your Manganese cool down.<br><br>
After that point, you can, then, begin to use the Strontium Aluminate.</p>
    <h4>7. Manganese Cool-Down</h4>
    <p>Forest found that taking Manganese supplements has helped her to cool down <i>the worst</i> of the N-Contamination. She started at a low dosage, to feel the 
      experience of having the extra Manganese in her body, beginning with eating higher amounts of Spinach and Hazelnuts (Manganese rich foods).</p>
    <h5>A) Manganese Supplements</h5>
    <p>“Man” “gun” “ease”, Manganese, is a mineral richly found in bog waters, in swamps. It is created by shellfish, and released into the soil, in the swamp areas, 
      by them. Farmers, then, harvest these deposits, from the soil, to create Manganese supplements. It can also be found in sea shells. This symbiotic relationship, 
      with shellfish, is extremely important to maintain, in order to keep our supply of manganese, for illnesses and outbreaks, such as N-Contamination. Forest has an 
      all Inclusive Kosher Vegan Diet. This diet requires plant-based Cannabidiods, commonly consumed, from meat. Plant-based Cannabidiods are found in Hemp, 
      Cannabis, and Marijuana. These plants are types of grains, that are vital, for insulin production, and digestion.<br><br>
After incorporating plant-based foods, high in Manganese, Forest realised that her body was craving the mineral, extremely. She ordered some Manganese supplements, 
      from Amazon, and transitioned over to the supplements, as soon as able. Starting by taking one 8mg tablet a day, she worked her way up to 40mg, of Manganese, a 
      day, by drinking the amount that she felt was needed, for her condition.<br><br>
After about two weeks on 40mg a day, of Manganese, Forest increased her dosage, for a few days, to about 200mg per day, at an as needed basis, based on her continuing 
      condition, being careful, not to take an amount, that would put out her own Organic Conductivity. Organic Conductivity is the amount of energy that a person 
      creates in order to function their body, organically, and involuntarily.<br><br>
Forest found that the mental understanding of “digesting the N-Contaminants to the Manganese, and not the Manganese to the N-Contaminants” was needed for this 
      cool-down process, although there were, also, times where her body needed to take Manganese to areas of N-Contamination, in order to continue this process, and 
      cool down the radiation.<br><br>
Forest encourages building the skill of understanding what your body needs, “at that time”.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"When I am figuring out my own dosing for these types of treatments or supplements, I pour what I feel that I organically need to have at that moment, not considering the rest of the day or how much I have left. This helps me to stay in a safe zone of 'in the moment' and to continue to be presently aware of what I am doing, rather than getting confused or lost by too much planning."
<br>~Forest van Eeden</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>B) Nuclear Tinea Cream</h5>
    <p>During the Manganese Cool-Down, it will be needed to create your own or purchase, if you can find it, some Manganese Cream. This cream is for use on your 
      genitals during this entire treatment. The detoxing of N- Contamination is Nuclear and does actually burn. It is highly recommended to have this cream 
      available at all times during your treatment, at least containing water dissolved Manganese as an added ingredient in your regular lotion or cream to have 
      on hand. It can be used as a spot treatment for joint pain, neck pain, or heart pain from Nuclear Cook, an experience that exists while having 
      N-Contamination.<br><br>
Do not use deodorant or lotions with aluminium or other heavy metals in them while having N-Contamination. It will intensify the burn.</p>
    <h4>8. Strontium Aluminate Nectar</h4>
    <p>After about a month or so, of Manganese Cool-Down, Forest, then, took about a tablespoon, of Strontium Aluminate Nectar, for one day. Strontium Aluminate Nectar
       is made with a pinch, such as that of a hair, of Strontium Aluminate powder, mixed with Agave Nectar, using a toothpick.</p>
    <p>This part of the treatment, really, is only meant to last for one day. This is a very intense mineral, that can be toxic, at high doses. It is commonly used to 
      add glow in the dark effects, in products.</p>
    <h5>A) Stronium Aluminate</h5>
    <p>Strontium Aluminate holds and pulls in neutrino particles, or light particles. Artificial light is much harsher on flesh, than natural Sunlight. 
      The Sun, organically, produces light by having a living ecosystem, just like the Earth, with water.<br><br>
Nuclear Energy, on the other hand, is a manmade version of starlight. While the effort to create clean energy, that is sustainable, and low on resources, is 
      justifiable, unfortunately, we are now finding that the planet Earth does not support, and is not compatible with, this type of energy production. We can 
      understand that at the core of our planet is something like Lava, not starlight.<br><br>
Strontium Aluminate is similar to minerals found deep in caves, having bioluminescent capabilities. It, organically, attracts light particles, and minerals, such as 
      light particles, to charge its glow. It does indeed glow! Strontium Aluminate is used, in this treatment process, at the end of the treatment, once the 
      majority of the N-Contaminants have been detoxed, successfully, because it has such a strong effect and can cause burns, if it is ingested too soon, after 
      N-Contamination.<br><br>
Being organic, during this process, is extremely important, because the digestion tract is made of flesh, like the rest of the body. Not rushing to meet a schedule, 
      or to make a flight, or bus, is extremely important because internal burning, which is already occurring, is being condensed, and expelled, through digestion. 
      Going slow, and steady, is certainly the way to go, but at an <i>organically</i> rapid pace, for <i>your own</i> Organic Preservation.<br><br>
The Strontium Aluminate will pull the remaining N-Contaminants towards itself, and go out your digestion tract, just like it did with the Manganese. It is 
      important to have all of the proper nutrition, that you need, <i>especially</i> cannabidiods, during this time, in order to keep your digestion working. If you can 
      get onto plant-based cannabidiods, prior to this treatment process, it will be best for you.
    <br><br><i>Strontium Aluminate, also, helps to calm, and reduce, the effects of fentanyl poisoning.</i></p>
    <h5>B) Cannabidiod Recovery</h5>
    <p>After this treatment, you will need to replenish your body’s nutrition, with an all inclusive, plant-based diet. Forest does recommend a Kosher Vegan Diet, 
      with Marijuana. Cannabidiods, found in Marijuana, are vital for the regrowth process of your body, after any type of damage. This is why many people begin to 
      crave meat, (Please, see <a href="https://forest-van-eeden.github.io/Discovery/carnivore/plant-based_taurine.html">Plant-Based Taurine</a> for further details and analysis), 
      when they are healing from injuries, or illnesses. Cannabidiods can only be found in meat, (from animals that ate Marijuana), or Marijuana plants.<br><br>
Forest also <i>recommends</i> not to get high off of Marijuana plants, being a type of nutritional high, but rather to microdose Marijuana, as a supplement for flour, 
      while baking or cooking, where possible, as it does share an ancestral genome with Common Wheat. It is a vital nutrient, and should be treated as such, rather 
      than a toy. You can use Hemp to make supplemented bread rolls, progressing further, with other forms of Cannabis, that is needed for your diet, (CBD, THC, THC-A, etc.).</p>
    <h4>9. Herbal Additions</h4>
    <p>During your detox, you may, also, find the need for some further Herbal Additions. These can include: tobacco, sage, lavender, mushrooms, and peppermint. 
      These should be used, as needed, in the same way we share using Manganese, and other nutrients. Tobacco tea can be used in a variety, of different types, of 
      salves or creams. Nicotine Lozanges or Mints are recommended forms of Tobacco, for the safety of burning from N-Contamination. Smoking should be minimised.
     When considering vaping, over smoking, a flame is more gentle (especially from matches), than battery preserved burning, such as in vaping devices. 
    Vaping can further N-Contamination, because of the electrical charges used for the devices.</p>
    <h4>10. Digestion Focus</h4>
    <p>At the end of your treatment, continue to remember to digest out the Strontium Aluminate (S.A.). Forest meditates on it, from time to time, in order to digest out 
      all of the N-Contamination. Remember that the reason for expelling it out through digestion is for your own Organic Preservation.<br><br>
Digest it out, like the Manganese. It contains N-Dodecane now, a Nuclear Preservative. You need to get it out.</p>
