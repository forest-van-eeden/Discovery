    <h1>Crossbreeding Hierarchy Theory</h1>
    <p>In life, there is a hierarchy to two joining families, in the way of crossbreeding. There is a "Queen Female", biologically pre-existing, in one species,
    while in the other, there is a "King Male". In order for their species to continue in growth together, being the first in line for procreation, organically, 
    they must commit to one another and have children together at some stage, while the King Male lives.
    <br><br>
    If the King Male dies or becomes ill, past a certain amount, another male is in line within the Queen Female's family, or species, for the continuation of life. 
		The first King Male is only fertile towards the Queen Female. When the first King Male dies, if it is before procreating offspring, that level of depth 
		is lost in life and crossbreeding has failed. 
		<br><br>
		A "Singular Mate" is the initial mate for a person. The Singular Mate is an instance 
		of one of a binary pair, between two, that is either male or female. The female's soul pre-exists the male's, whose soul is made 
		out of the female's. The male's body is born in life, of the Singular Mates, before the female's body is born, where they are both 
		living.
		<br><br>
		When we are considering a King or Queen within a species, the two, first, merging to crossbreed between two species; if the 
    King Male has died or been overcome with illness, of the two, fertility transitions to the second male, 
		the twin of the Queen Female, within their species. The species, or family, goes down a level in complexity, into inbreeding.
		<br><br>
		The species or the family of the King Male dies, and life goes into mourning.
		<br><br>
		If there are further losses, such as the twin of the Queen Female, fertility transitions to their younger brother, with her, 
		remaining in inbreeding. All three males are the Singular Mate of the Queen Female. All three are 
    made to take care of the Queen Female as her husbands.
		<br><br>
		If the Queen Female dies, then that level of depth of complexity is lost within the species. It would not be until another birth 
		of a Queen Female and King Male, that there would be another chance of crossbreeding between species.
    <br><br>
    Prior to any form of conception with the King Male, the Queen Female would grow with her Twin Male (her initial "husband"), until a certain point of fertility.
    This is when a branch of fertility occurs into the new species. The growth between her and her Twin Male occurs at the end of an entire species. All families in 
    said species have procreated, in this instance, and the resulting end of the breeding of the species is a set of Male & Female twins. In this way, if anything occurs 
    beyond the control of the species, for the life of it, holding the Queen Female, Life for the species can fall back on the pair of binary twins. Of the parents, one 
    parent's lineage favors one twin, normally the mother to the Male Twin Child and the other favors the other twin, normally the Father to the Female Twin Child (the Queen Female).
