    <h1>Hierarchy</h1>
    <p>In life, there is a hierarchy to two joining families in the way of crossbreeding. There is a Queen Female, biologically existing, in one species,
    while in the other there is a King Male. In order for their species to continue in growth together, being the first in line for procreation, organically, 
    they must commit to one another and have children together at some stage, while they live.
    <br><br>
    If they die, another pair is in line within their family or species for the continuation of life. The first King Male is only fertile towards
     his Queen Female. When the first pair dies, that level of depth is lost in the species. The species or family goes down a level in complexity  
      if their King and Queen die before they are able to procreate.
