    <h1>Crossbreeding Hierarchy Theory</h1>
    <p>In life, there is a hierarchy to two joining families, in the way of crossbreeding. There is a "Queen Female", biologically pre-existing, in one species,
    while in the other, there are "King Males", as well as the Queen's Half-Twin Brother. In order for their species to continue in growth together, being the first in line for procreation, organically, 
    they must commit to one another and have children together at some stage, while the King Males live.
    <br><br>
    If the King Males dies or becomes ill, past a certain amount, their part of life is lost within the Queen Female's family, or species, for the continuation of life. 
    All of the King Males are only fertile towards the Queen Female. When the new family's King Males die, if it is before procreating offspring, that level of depth 
		is lost in life and crossbreeding has failed. 
		<br><br>
		A "Singular Mate" is the initial mate or mates for a person. The Singular Mate is an instance 
		of one of a binary sense of pairing, between two forms of being, that is either male or female. The female's soul pre-exists the male's, whose soul is made 
		out of the female's in a physical form of evolution, but does exist on his own as a person prior to this. The first male's body is born in life, of the Singular Mates, before the female's body is born, where they are both 
		living or all live together.
		<br><br>
		When we are considering Kings or a Queen within a species, the two, first, merging to crossbreed between two species; if the 
    King Males have died or been overcome with illness, of the two, the King Male's soul live within the Queen.
		The half-twin of the Queen Female, within her species, is also a King Male, to carry the seed for the next Queen Female. 
    The species, or family, goes down a level in complexity, into inbreeding if there are no more potential species from where the King Males with the male seeds can exist again.
		<br><br>
		The species or the family of the King Males die, and life goes into mourning, but this would have to be a form of evolution and does not currently actually exist and remains hypothetical.
		<br><br>
		If there are further losses, such as the twin of the Queen Female, fertility transitions to the younger brother, with the King Species. 
    All three males are the Singular Mates of the Queen Female. All three are 
    made to take care of the Queen Female as her husbands. There cannot be more than one female for a male. Only up to 3 males can exist for a single female.
		<br><br>
		If the Queen Female dies, then that level of depth of complexity is lost within the species. It would not be until another birth or rebirth
		of the Queen Female or the King Males, that there would be another chance of crossbreeding between species, in the event that their deaths do not occur as a result of an extinction event.
    <br><br>
    Prior to any form of conception with a King Male, the Queen Female would grow with her Twin Male (her initial "husband" from her own conception in the womb), until a certain point of fertility, in an ideal situation where these events are not prolonged.
    This is when a branch of fertility occurs into the new species. The growth between her and her Twin King Male occurs at the end of an entire species. All families in 
    said species have procreated together already, in this instance, and the resulting end of the breeding of the species is a set of Male & Female twins. No one else remains existing. In this way, if anything occurs 
    beyond the control of the species, for the life of it, holding the Queen Female, Life for the species can fall back on the pair of binary twins. Of the parents, one 
    male's lineage goes to one twin, and the other half goes to the other twin child. In the new species, there are only two resulting King Males existing as brothers, one older and one younger, both older in age than the Queen Female.
    Their species is divided in genetics between the two siblings in that way. 
    <br><br> 
    The parents of both pairs of children in each species are in the form of two males going towards one female. 
    In form of terms of Royalty, generally, in the Government Systems, the Kings and Queens are the new born children.
    But, in terms of crossbreeding, fertility, and age of soul and evolution, it is the Crossbreeding Mates that are the most 
    ancient in being and have the terms of Kings and Queen reserved as known in respectfulness and attentiveness to needs for change 
    or immediate action and response.
    <br><br>
    The children of from the Royal Family (the Kings and Queen), are a set of triplets. Thare are two males that are half new species, half Queen species, and a fully Queen species female. 
    The three are Singular Mates together and continue the new genetics in the species for all of those now in the Queen's family.
