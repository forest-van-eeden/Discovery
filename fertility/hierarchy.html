    <h1>Hierarchy</h1>
    <p>In life, there is a hierarchy to two joining families in the way of crossbreeding. There is a Queen Female, biologically existing, in one species,
    while in the other there is a King Male. In order for their species to continue in growth together, being the first in line for procreation, organically, 
    they must commit to one another and have children together at some stage, while the King Male lives.
    <br><br>
    If the King Male dies, another male is in line within the Queen Female's family or species for the continuation of life. The first King Male is only fertile towards
     the Queen Female. When the first King Male dies, the Singular Mate of the Queen Female becomes her second male, who is then King. The species or family of the first 
      King Male dies and life goes into mourning.
