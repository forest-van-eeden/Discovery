  <h1>Hormones</h1>
  <p>
Inorganic Hormones can throw off the balance between Male and Female Mates. If a Male takes Estrogen as a hormone, it can actually
deplete the Estrogen levels naturally occurring in their Female and kill her. It is a sad occurrance for a Male to mix themselves into 
believing they are their Female with Estrogen Hormones under medical supervision. Infertility occurs here when the Male is then incapable 
of being fertile with their Female because they are not in natural balance with their natural hormones.
